# "Colorful"ness

According to users, a UI with only a primary color, fg color, background color, etc that have a similar hue doesn't look "colorful" enough. Although I at first did not agree with such, After actually looking at my own work, I realize they might be right. A mainly-one-hue UI is a pain to look at.

However, making random buttons random colors like other websites just looks terrible and inconsistent. What's the solution?: Color + emphasis

## Using color for emphasis
